\chapter{Generation, control and detection of 3D vortex structures in superfluid systems}
\label{ch-3d}

In Chapters~\ref{ch-1d} and~\ref{ch-2d}, we discussed various methods for quantum engineering involving one and two dimensional systems, respectively.
In this chapter, we will discuss specific implementation details for three-dimensional vortex generation and provide an example through which we may control three-dimensional vortex structures in BEC systems by using the artificial magnetic field generated by optical nanofibers.
