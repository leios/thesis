, as well as vortex arrays. When the nonuniform condensate contains a vortex,
 the excitation spectrum includes unstable (`anomalous') mode(s) with negativ
e frequency. Trap rotation shifts the normal-mode frequencies and can stabili
ze the vortex. We consider the effect of thermal quasiparticles on vortex nor
mal modes as well as possible mechanisms for vortex dissipation. Vortex state

 Landau superfluid density ϱs(T). For a singly quantized vortex with core rad
ius ξ, the asymptotic properties (r → ∞) are given by n(r) ∼ n[1 + O(ξ2r2)] a
nd jθ(r) ∼ (nh̵mr)[1 + O(ξ2r2)], where n = n0 + n′ is the total density (conde
nsate plus noncondensate) in a uniform system. Near the axis of the vortex, n
(0) = n′(0) is estimated to be ≈ 1.4 n′, yet jθ(r) vanishes linearly, implyin

lies on the nearly plane, or two-dimensional, nature of the flow in the neigh

In preparation for the numerics we scale the 3d Gross–Pitaevskii equation and obtain a four-parameter model. Identifying ‘extreme parameter regi
mes’, the model is accessible to analytical perturbation theory, which justifies formal procedures well known in the physical literature: reduction to 2d and 1d GPEs, approximation of ground state solutions of the \{GPE\} and geometrical optics approximations. Then we use a time-splitting spectral method to discretize
 the time-dependent GPE. Again, perturbation theory is used to understand the discretization scheme and to choose the spatial/temporal grid in dependence of the perturbation parameter. Extensive numerical examples in 1d, 2d and 3d for weak/strong interactions, defocusing/focusing nonlinearity, and zero/nonzero initial
 phase data are presented to demonstrate the power of the numerical method and to discuss the physics of Bose–Einstein condensation. "

er as far as the nanofiber waist, the effect of varying the cladding-core radius ratio on the \{LP11\} adiabatic criterion is modeled. A Laguerre\342\200\223Gaussian beam is created in free space using a spatial light modulator
 (SLM) and coupled to a few-mode fiber. This device allows convenient switching between the fundamental and \{LP11\} fiber modes. By selecting a few-mode fiber with a relatively low cladding-core ratio, the propagation of the \
{LP11\} mode down to a submicron waist has been maintained. Furthermore, by observing the transmission profile during tapering, it is possible to decisively terminate the pulling process in order to eliminate the two degenerate
 \{HE21\} modes of the \{LP11\} mode. As a result, a nanofiber can be fabricated through which only the \{TE01\} and \{TM01\} components of the \{LP11\} mode propagate. Such a nanofiber has promising applications in the area of
 mode interference for controlled particle trapping sites. "

abstract ={A method is described for the minimization of a function of n variables, which depends on the comparison of function values at the (n + 1) vertices of a general simplex, followed by the replacement of the vertex with the highest value by another point. The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.},

  abstract={Adiabatic techniques can be used to control quantum states with high fidelity while exercising limited control over the parameters of a system. However, because these techniques are slow compared to other timescales
 in the system, they are usually not suitable for creating highly unstable states or performing time-critical processes. Both of these situations arise in quantum information processing, where entangled states may be isolated f
rom the environment only for a short time and where quantum computers require high-fidelity operations to be performed quickly. Recently it has been shown that techniques like optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity can b
e used to prepare quantum states non-adiabatically with high fidelity. Here we present two examples of how these techniques can be used to create maximally entangled many-body NOON states in one-dimensional Tonks\342\200\223Gir

 abstract = {A modified split-step Fourier method (SSFM) is presented to solve
the coupled nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation (CNLS) that can be used
to model high-speed pulse propagation in optical fibres with
polarization mode dispersion (PMD). We compare our
approach with the SSFM and demonstrate that our approach is much
faster with no loss of accuracy. We discuss the pulse distortion
and system  Q-factor of non-return-to-zero (NRZ), return-to-zero (RZ)
and pre-chirped RZ (CRZ) formats in the presence of high PMD through
this approach. The simulation results show that CRZ pulses are the
most tolerant to high PMD values and the extinct ratio has a great
impact on the transmission performance.}
