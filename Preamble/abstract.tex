The split-step Fourier method is a powerful technique for solving partial differential equations and simulating quantum systems of various forms.
In this body of work, we focus on several variations of this method to allow for simulations of one, two, and three-dimensional quantum systems, along with several notable methods for controlling these systems.
In particular, we use quantum optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity to study the non-adiabatic generation of superposition states in strongly correlated one-dimensional systems, analyze chaotic vortex trajectories in two dimensions by using rotation and phase imprinting methods, and create stable, three-dimensional vortex structures in Bose--Einstein condensates through artificial magnetic fields generated by the evanescent field of an optical nanofiber.
We also discuss algorithmic optimizations for implementing the compressed split-step Fourier method for graphics processing units and multicomponent simulations.
All variations present in this work are justified with physical systems where such techniques have been applied and have been incorporated into a state-of-the-art and open-source software suite known as GPUE, which is currently the fastest quantum simulator of its kind.
