The split-step Fourier method is a powerful technique for solving partial differential equations and simulating quantum systems of various forms.
In this body of work, we focus on several variations of this method to allow for simulations of one, two, and three-dimensional quantum systems, along with several notable methods for controlling quantum systems, including quantum optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity.
We also examine the creation of stable, three-dimensional vortex structures in Bose--Einstein condensates through rotation, artificial magnetic fields, and phase imprinting, and we analyze chaotic vortex trajectories in two dimensions.
In addition, we discuss algorithmic optimizations for implementing the compressed split-step Fourier method for graphics processing units and multicomponent simulations.
All features present in this work have been incorporated into a state-of-the-art and open-source software suite known as GPUE and are justified with physical systems where such techniques have been applied.
