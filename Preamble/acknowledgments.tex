Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the work of my advisor, Thomas Busch.
His tireless effort to help his students pursue their best interests is honestly inspiring.
I greatly appreciate his kindness, honesty, and willingness to try new things.
I would also like to acknowledge the work of my online community, the Algorithm Archivists, as they constantly motivated me to learn new methods for my research.
This work has been supported by the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) Graduate University and used the computing resources of the Scientific Computing and Data Analysis section.
This work has also been supported by JSPS KAKENHI JP17J01488.
I would also like to thank (in no particular order) Lee, Mossy, Angela, Albert, J\'er\'emie, Peter, Irina, Ben, Tiantian, Peter (2), Rashi, Valentin, Ankur, the Quantum Systems Unit, and the OIST community for being such wonderful people and helping to varying degrees throughout my time at OIST.
Finally, I would like to thank Ayaka for helping me focus on something other than work for a change.
